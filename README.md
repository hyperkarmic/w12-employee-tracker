# Employee Tracker

'Employee Tracker' is NodeJS application, that uses sql and express and inquirer, to tabulate
,update create and delete information about employees, managers, departments, job-roles and salaries at any given work-place.

## Installation

All the dependencies can be installed using 'npm install'. The 'start file' is index.js

## Usage

Selecting an option, once the application has been started, will either automatically return the query, or further prompts will be given, to ensure the right query can be returned. An changes to the database/seed file will need to be implemented at 'Workbench' level.
